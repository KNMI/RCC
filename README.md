Research Code of Conduct

### Why a Research Code of Conduct?

Reproducibility of research is a very important factor...

### Version control

- version control from the start  
  (open repos on the KNMI github account - private repos e.g. via bitbucket)
- Lab book
- Github buddy
- Disclaimer:

### Writing

We encourage the use of traceable files, e.g. Latex or (variants of) markdown.
Word files can be set under version control, but changes between different
versions can not be shown.

Annotations can be made also in a pdf document, e.g using Adobe Acrobat.

### Data management

- don't copy and paste data
- scripts for downloading data

### Repository management

Try to structure your repository ...
Folders that you will encounter frequently:

 - data (for all the data)
 - figures (for your plots)
 - R (for your functions)
 - src (for source code)
 - scripts 

### Coding standards

- Python: PEP8
- R: ...

### Sugar on top?

- docker
- jupyter
- travis
- automated documentation (e.g. roxygen)
